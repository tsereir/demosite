## Bio
I’m an intern at [Capital Fund Management](https://www.cfm.com/) in Paris, diving into the complexities of American options pricing with the volatility team. My work involves exploring advanced pricing methods and developing solutions using Python, C++, and Rust.

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Financial Engineering at ENSIMAG in Grenoble, where I delve into quantitative finance, stochastic calculus, and derivatives.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies and problem-solving. I’m also passionate about sharing knowledge and contributing to the finance and tech communities.

**Interests:** Quantitative Finance, Algorithm Development, Financial Technology, Continuous Learning 


## Inquiries
If you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, feel free to [contact me](mailto:tariq.sereir77@gmail.com). I am always interested in discussing workshop offerings and collaborative opportunities.

<!-- ## Mentorship
I am open to acting as a mentor to youth navigating a career in science when I have the capacity. If you are part of a group which has historically been excluded from STEM and are seeking a mentor, please [reach out via email](mailto:tariq.sereir77@gmail.com) with a short introduction about yourself.  -->
